title: About me
subtitle: From 0 to Data Scientist 
---

Living in Florida my entire life I’ve done everything from free diving in the Atlantic ocean to hiking the everglades, but its time for a new adventure. I set my sights and aspirations on becoming a data scientist. After discovering coding and data analytics I knew it was a path I was meant to be on. If Brazilian jiu jitsu and competitive power-lifting has taught me anything its that with a little perseverance, determination and dedication anything is possible.

My work ethic and hobbies allowed me to developed many skills that make me essential to any team. I am always dedicated one hundred percent to anything I do and will find a solution even if it is not immediately shown or given to me. In school I would always study from external sources in addition to the curriculum to ensure that I understood the material to the fullest. Even if I don’t use that external knowledge immediately I have familiarized myself with concepts for the next time I come across it.  I strongly identify with the idea of being a student of and for life. I believe in the idea of being able to learn from everyone so most of my interactions I strive to be a strong listener. Listening has given me the tools to problem solve and often I am in the position of moderator because I aim for the root of the problem rather than the situation itself. Listening has helped me with the words and statements I choose. I have found that I am able to add real value to conversations when I choose my words more meaningfully. Being the smartest person in the room is not my focus my goal is to be part of and work towards the common mission efficiently.
